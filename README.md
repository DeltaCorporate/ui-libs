# Why this project?

Choosing the right UI library is hard. This project is a simple tool to help you pick the right one, based on your own criterias.

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, especially because UI libraries often update.

There is no database, data lives in Typescript objects, which means any edit suggestion can be done using a PR.

# Setup

The project itself is a Nuxt 3 project using Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS.

This repository is based on a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). If you're using VS Code and have Docker and the VS Code Dev Containers extension installed, you can run this project easily on your own machine using the `Clone Repository` command on your IDE.

Once installed, run `npm run dev` to start the project.
