# Why this project?

Choosing the right UI library is hard. This project is a simple tool to help you pick the right one, based on your own criterias.

# About me

I'm David, 35, living in Paris, and available for hiring.
Visit [my website](https://david-dahan.com) to know more about me.

If you want to show your support, you can sponsor me on Github, or buy me a coffee. This will be very appreciated.

# Contributions

Contributions are very welcome, especially because UI libraries often change over time.

There is no database. To update data, change `utils/libraries.ts` and make a PR.

# Setup on your own machine

The project itself is a Nuxt 3 project using Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS.

This repository is based on a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). If you're using VS Code and have Docker and the VS Code Dev Containers extension installed, you can run this project easily on your own machine using the `Clone Repository` command on your IDE.

Once installed, run `npm run dev` to start the project.

As a simpler alternative, you can use vscode.dev to edit it.
