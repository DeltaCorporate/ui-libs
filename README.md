# Why this project?

Choosing the right UI library is hard. This project is a simple tool to help you pick the right one, based on your own criterias.

# About me

# How to Contribute

Contributions are very welcome, especially because UI libraries change often over time.

There is no database. To suggest a data update, simply change `utils/libraries.ts` and make a PR.

# How to setup the project on your own machine

The project itself is a Nuxt 3 project using Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS.

This repository is based on a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). If you're using VS Code, you can run this project easily on your own machine using the `Clone Repository` command on your IDE.

Once installed, run `npm run dev` to start the project.

# Why Library X is not listed?

I may have forgotten some libraries, so feel free to open a PR. However, the purpose is not to have a comprehensive list, but rather keep a curated list of "serious" projects.
