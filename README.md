# About

### Why this project?

Choosing the right UI library is hard! There are many things to consider. This project is a simple tool to have an overview of different UI frameworks, and help you pick the right one.

### How does it work?

- Hover features to know about them, and click them to filter libraries which implement it
- For any library, you can see the detail of available components

# Contributions

### How to Contribute

Contributions are very welcome both on features and on content, especially because UI libraries change a lot over time.

There is no database. To suggest a data update, simply change data into `data/` folder and make a PR.

### How to setup the project on your own machine

The project itself is a Nuxt 3 project using Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS.

This repository is based on a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). If you're using VS Code, you can run this project easily on your own machine using the `Clone Repository` command on your IDE.

Once installed, run `npm run dev` to start the project.

# FAQ

### Why Library X is not listed?

- It does not support the latest Vue or Nuxt version.
- It seems unmaintained (e.g., [iView](https://github.com/iview/iview))
- It looks like more an "in progress" that final work (e.g., [Radix-vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/))
- It aims to mirror Android / iOS UIs (e.g., [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/), [Framework7](https://framework7.io/)).

However, I may have forgotten some relevant libraries, so feel free to open a PR. Note that the purpose of this tool is not to have a comprehensive list, but rather keep a curated list of "serious" projects.

### Why Component X is not listed?

- It's too basic to be relevant (e.g., A Loading Spinner)
- It's a "block" (a composition of different UI components) rather than a component (e.g., Hero, NavBar)
- It's a pure utility which could or should live in a collection of utilities like [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/)
- It's a broad familiy of dedicated components that make sense to have apart (e.g. Charts)
